Learning Outcomes for the course: After successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to: 

- Develop an appreciation of the pieces that make up the web landscape and how these pieces interact with each other.
- Aquire the skills needed to build a complete web application that incorporates session management, database access, and analytics on the server side, and page formatting and interactivity on the client side. 
- Build restful web services that interact with Ajax-powered client apps using a variety of transport protocols for data transfer. 
- Become familiar with, and adhere to, best practices and design patterns to ensure code maintainability, interoperability, and scalability, and to minimize exploitable vulnerabilities. 
- Learn how to build complex applications collaboratively through building abstractions and APIs, naming conventions, documentation, and organizing.
- Compare and contrast existing frameworks and approaches and develop an insight into the tectonic forces that are driving the trends.
